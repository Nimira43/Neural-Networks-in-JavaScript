## Perceptron 4 Code Explanation

#### Data Setup:

###### trainInputs and testInputs: These arrays contain feature vectors for training and testing.

###### trainLabels and testLabels: These arrays contain the corresponding labels (1 for Pencil, 0 for Eraser).

#### Perceptron Class:

###### Constructor: Initialises weights, bias, and learning rate.

###### Activation Function: A step function that outputs 1 if the input is >= 0, otherwise 0.

###### Predict: Computes the weighted sum of inputs and passes it through the activation function.

###### Train: Updates the weights and bias based on the prediction error.

###### Calculate Accuracy: Computes the accuracy of predictions on given data.

#### Training the Model:

###### Trains the perceptron for a specified number of epochs using the training data.

#### Evaluating the Model:

###### Computes and prints the training and testing accuracy.

#### Results
###### Training Accuracy: Indicates how well the model performs on the training data.

###### Testing Accuracy: Indicates how well the model generalises to unseen data.

#### Evaluating Overfitting and Underfitting
###### Overfitting: If the training accuracy is very high but the testing accuracy is significantly lower, the model might be overfitting. This means it has learned the training data too well, including noise and specific patterns that do not generalise to new data.

###### Underfitting: If both training and testing accuracies are low, the model might be underfitting. This means it has not learned the underlying patterns in the data well enough.

## Perceptron 4 Model's Performance

#### Based on the provided accuracies:

###### If the training accuracy is significantly higher than the testing accuracy, your model might be overfitting.

###### If both accuracies are low, it might be underfitting.

## Potential Improvements

#### For Overfitting:

###### Increase the Training Data: More data can help the model generalise better.

###### Simplify the Model: Use fewer features or reduce the complexity.

###### Regularisation: Apply techniques like L2 regularisation to prevent the model from fitting the noise.

#### For Underfitting:

###### Increase Model Complexity: Add more features or use a more complex model (e.g., a multi-layer perceptron).

###### More Training Epochs: Train the model for more epochs to allow it to learn better.
