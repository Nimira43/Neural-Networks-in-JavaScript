# Background Math 

## Linear Algebra 

##### The study of Vectors, Vector Spaces (Linear Spaces), Linear Transformations and Systems of Linear Equations

##### Provides a framework for understanding the properties and operations of these mathematical objects which can be represented using matrices and vectors (scalars) 

### Important applications of Linear Algebra in Data Science

1) Data representation and manipulation – example use case = to predict the price of a house using a dataset.

###### Input Features						         
Area of house
Rooms			     
Location

###### USE MODEL

###### Output Features
Price

###### Notes 

[Area, Rooms, Location, Price] 	=> 	VECTOR

The parts of the vector quantify the relationship between each other – such as the size of house, number of rooms, the location. 

quantify the relationship => covariance, correlation

### Dimensions and Vectors

2 dimension vector = (x, y)
