# Data

## Structured Data

###### Structured data is highly organized and easily searchable in databases. It’s formatted in rows and columns, often in tabular forms like spreadsheets or SQL databases. Each field within the data has a defined data type, such as integers, strings, or dates

#### Examples

###### Excel spreadsheets

###### SQL databases

###### CSV files

## Unstructured Data

###### Unstructured data lacks a predefined format or organisation, making it more challenging to collect, process, and analyse. This type of data doesn’t fit neatly into tables or databases and often requires more advanced techniques to extract meaningful information

#### Examples

###### Text documents (e.g., emails, reports)

###### Images and videos

###### Audio files

###### Social media posts

## Semi-Structured Data

###### This type of data doesn’t fit the rigid structure of relational databases but still has some organizational properties that make it easier to analyse than unstructured data. It often contains tags or markers to separate different elements

#### Examples

###### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files

###### XML (eXtensible Markup Language) files

###### NoSQL databases

## Metadata

###### Metadata is data that describes other data. It provides information about the context, quality, condition, or characteristics of the data, making it easier to understand and manage

#### Examples

###### File properties (e.g., file size, creation date)

###### Database schemas

###### Tags and keywords on media files

## Time-Series Data

###### Time-series data is a sequence of data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals. This type of data is often used for tracking changes over time

#### Examples

###### Stock prices

###### Weather data

###### Sensor readings

## Summary

###### Structured Data: Highly organized and easily searchable (e.g., databases, spreadsheets)

###### Unstructured Data: Lacks a predefined format, requiring more complex analysis (e.g., text, images)

###### Semi-Structured Data: Contains tags or markers for partial organization (e.g., JSON, XML)

###### Metadata: Describes other data (e.g., file properties)

###### Time-Series Data: Data points recorded over time intervals (e.g., stock prices)

###### Each type of data requires different methods for storage, processing, and analysis. Understanding these distinctions helps in selecting the right tools and techniques for your data science projects
