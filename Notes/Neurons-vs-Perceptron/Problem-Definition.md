# Problem Definition

## Supervised Learning

#### Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, meaning that each training example is paired with an output label. The model learns to predict the output from the input data

#### Examples

###### Classification: Identifying the category of an object. For example, classifying emails as spam or not spam

###### Regression: Predicting a continuous value. For example, predicting the price of a house based on its features

## Unsupervised Learning

#### Unsupervised learning involves training a model on a dataset without labeled responses. The model tries to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the input data

#### Examples

###### Clustering: Grouping similar data points together. For example, customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior

###### Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of features in a dataset while retaining important information. For example, using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce features in image recognition

## Classification

#### Classification is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict discrete labels or categories

###### Binary Classification: Two possible outcomes (e.g., spam vs. non-spam)

###### Multiclass Classification: More than two possible outcomes (e.g., classifying types of fruits: apple, banana, orange)

## Regression

#### Regression is another type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict a continuous value

###### Linear Regression: Predicting a continuous value by fitting a linear relationship between the input and output (e.g., predicting house prices)

###### Polynomial Regression: Extending linear regression by allowing for more complex relationships (e.g., fitting a curve to predict temperature variations)

## Summary

###### Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data to predict outcomes (Classification and Regression)

###### Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns in unlabeled data (Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction)

###### Classification: Predicts discrete categories

###### Regression: Predicts continuous values
