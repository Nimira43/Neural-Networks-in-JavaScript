# Problem Definition & Data in the Real World

# A Formula 1 Team

## Problem Definition

###### For an F1 team, the problem definitions can be quite specific and multifaceted. Here are some key areas

###### Aerodynamic Efficiency: How can we improve the car's aerodynamics to reduce drag and increase downforce?

###### Engine Performance: How can we optimize the engine for better power output and fuel efficiency?

###### Tyre Management: How can we manage tyre wear and temperature to maintain optimal grip throughout the race?

###### Driver Performance: How can we enhance the driver's performance through better training, feedback, and car setup?

###### Race Strategy: How can we develop the best race strategy considering weather conditions, track layout, and competitor performance?

## Data

###### To address these problem definitions, F1 teams collect and analyse various types of data

###### Telemetry Data: This includes real-time data from sensors on the car, such as speed, throttle position, brake pressure, steering angle, and suspension loads. This data helps in understanding the car's performance and identifying areas for improvement

###### Aerodynamic Data: Wind tunnel testing and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations provide data on airflow around the car, helping to optimise the aerodynamic design

###### Engine Data: Data on engine performance, including fuel consumption, turbo boost levels, and engine temperatures, is crucial for optimising engine settings

###### Tyre Data: Information on tyre temperatures, pressures, and wear patterns helps in managing tyre performance and making strategic decisions during the race

###### Driver Data: Data on the driver's inputs, such as steering, braking, and throttle usage, helps in providing feedback and improving driver performance

###### Historical Data: Past race data, including lap times, race results, and weather conditions, is used to develop race strategies and predict future performance

#### By combining these data types with advanced analytics and machine learning techniques, F1 teams can gain valuable insights and make data-driven decisions to stay competitive
