## Neural Networks and Perceptrons

#### Neural Networks: 
###### These are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks of animal brains. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers: an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each connection between neurons has an associated weight that gets adjusted during training.

#### Perceptrons: 
###### A perceptron is a type of artificial neuron used in machine learning. It's the simplest type of neural network model, consisting of a single layer of input nodes connected to an output node. The perceptron makes decisions by weighing input signals and applying a threshold to produce a binary output.

## Classifying Objects
###### Neural networks are used extensively for classification tasks, such as recognising objects in images. During training, the network learns to associate inputs (features) with the correct output (class labels).

## Overfitting and Underfitting
###### These are two common issues that arise when training neural networks:

#### Overfitting
###### Definition: Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and outliers. As a result, it performs well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data.

###### Symptoms: High accuracy on training data and significantly lower accuracy on validation or test data.

###### Causes: Overly complex models with too many parameters, not enough training data, or insufficient regularisation.

###### Solutions:
###### Use more training data.
###### Simplify the model (reduce the number of parameters).
###### Apply regularisation techniques (e.g., L1/L2 regularisation).
###### Use dropout, which randomly drops neurons during training to prevent over-reliance on specific neurons.

#### Underfitting
###### Definition: Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. It fails to perform well on both training and test data.

###### Symptoms: Low accuracy on both training and validation/test data.

###### Causes: Models that are too simple, insufficient training time, or poor representation of the data.

###### Solutions:
###### Use more complex models (e.g., more layers or neurons).
###### Increase the number of training epochs.
###### Improve feature engineering or use more relevant features.

#### Detecting Overfitting and Underfitting
###### Training and Validation Curves: Plot the model's performance (accuracy or loss) on the training and validation datasets over time.

###### Overfitting: The training performance improves while the validation performance starts to degrade.

###### Underfitting: Both training and validation performance are poor.

###### Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation techniques to evaluate model performance on different subsets of the data, helping to detect overfitting.

###### Learning Curves: Plot learning curves to visualise how the model's learning progresses with more data and training time.

###### By understanding and addressing overfitting and underfitting, you can create more robust models that generalise well to new data, ultimately leading to better classification performance.
