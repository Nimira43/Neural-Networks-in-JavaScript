## Perceptron 4 Code Explanation

#### Data Setup:

###### trainInputs and testInputs: These arrays contain feature vectors for training and testing.

###### trainLabels and testLabels: These arrays contain the corresponding labels (1 for Pencil, 0 for Eraser).

#### Perceptron Class:

###### Constructor: Initialises weights, bias, and learning rate.

###### Activation Function: A step function that outputs 1 if the input is >= 0, otherwise 0.

###### Predict: Computes the weighted sum of inputs and passes it through the activation function.

###### Train: Updates the weights and bias based on the prediction error.

###### Calculate Accuracy: Computes the accuracy of predictions on given data.

#### Training the Model:

###### Trains the perceptron for a specified number of epochs using the training data.

#### Evaluating the Model:

###### Computes and prints the training and testing accuracy.

#### Results
###### Training Accuracy: Indicates how well the model performs on the training data.

###### Testing Accuracy: Indicates how well the model generalises to unseen data.

#### Evaluating Overfitting and Underfitting
###### Overfitting: If the training accuracy is very high but the testing accuracy is significantly lower, the model might be overfitting. This means it has learned the training data too well, including noise and specific patterns that do not generalise to new data.

###### Underfitting: If both training and testing accuracies are low, the model might be underfitting. This means it has not learned the underlying patterns in the data well enough.

#### Perceptron 4 Model's Performance

##### Based on the provided accuracies:

###### If the training accuracy is significantly higher than the testing accuracy, your model might be overfitting.

###### If both accuracies are low, it might be underfitting.

#### Potential Improvements

##### For Overfitting:

###### Increase the Training Data: More data can help the model generalise better.

###### Simplify the Model: Use fewer features or reduce the complexity.

###### Regularisation: Apply techniques like L2 regularisation to prevent the model from fitting the noise.

##### For Underfitting:

###### Increase Model Complexity: Add more features or use a more complex model (e.g., a multi-layer perceptron).

###### More Training Epochs: Train the model for more epochs to allow it to learn better.

## Verdict 

#### Overfitting and Generalization

###### Overfitting Signs: The model performs perfectly on training data but has a gap in performance on test data, indicating it might be overfitting.

###### Consistent Test Accuracy: Increasing epochs doesn't improve test accuracy, which suggests the model has plateaued in terms of what it can learn from the given data.

#### Potential Solutions and Improvements

##### 1. Increase Training Data
###### More diverse and extensive training data can help the model learn better generalisations and reduce overfitting.

##### 2. Regularisation Techniques
###### Apply regulariation to prevent the model from overfitting. Common techniques include:

###### L2 Regularization (Ridge Regression): Adds a penalty equal to the sum of the squared values of the coefficients.

###### L1 Regularization (Lasso Regression): Adds a penalty equal to the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients.

##### 3. Cross-Validation
###### Use cross-validation to ensure the model generalises well across different subsets of the data.

##### 4. Feature Engineering
###### New Features: Consider creating new, more informative features.

###### Feature Scaling: Ensure your features are scaled properly, especially if they have different units or magnitudes.

##### 5. Model Complexity
###### Increase Complexity: Add more neurons or layers, or use a different model like a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) which can capture more complex patterns.
